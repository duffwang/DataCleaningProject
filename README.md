DataCleaningProject
===================

###Run Analysis script
The script run_analysis.R will clean up data from the 
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set.

It will create a tidy dataset containing only the mean and standard deviation of each
measurement, as well as use descriptive activity labels. This is called dfDataClean

It also creates a second data set that shows the average for each measurement by actvity and subject. This 
is called dfDataSummary
